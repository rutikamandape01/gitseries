Hello everyone,

## TASK 2

**(A) How git workflow works?**
There are four fundamental elements is git workflow:
1. workspace
1. Index
1. loacal repository
1. Remote repository
There is one Central repository. Clone command is there which is used to create copies of repository . And make changes locally using commit command. Then pushes it to the central repository so that any other developer wanting to make any change can pull and use in their work.

**(B) What're the different stages of a git project as commit, add?** 
Git Workflow consist of the four fundamental elements: 
•	Workspace( Working Directory) and if we consider a file, it can have 3 states:
 (a)Committed : meaning latest changes in the data is stored in local repo.
 (b)Modified: means the changes are done but are not securely stored or will not be reflected in local repository.
 (c)Staged: meaning file is part of index element.

•	Index
•	Local Repository(also known as Head)
•	Remote Repository
  
• clone :  If we are gaining access to a remote repository then we need to clone it by following it by URL using git clone command which will create a local cpopy of repository in our workspace.
• Add : This command will add the file in the workspace in the index stage and thus we call this file as staged file.
• Commit :  This command will commit all files that are staged with their changes and are safely stored.
             
• Push : It pushes the changes that are in the local repository to the remote repository and anyonce having access to this remote repo can see the changes.
 
For reverse flow we have following commands:

• Fetch : Used to get files from the remote repository to local repository.
• Merge : It get changes from local repo and get them to workspace.
• diff : Used to tell the difference between files which are in workspace and ones which are stagged for commit.

**(c) Is it possible to do a git commit before git add . if you have made any changes? Explain why?**
No ,it is not possible to do git commit before git add . because according to workflow, we first have to add the file to the staging area and then we can commit changes in the respective file in local repository.

 **(d) Why is git diff used?**
Diff command is used to track  the difference or changes made on a file.

 **(e) Can we leave the commit message as blank?**
Yes, we can leave the commit message as blank .  we can leave the commit message as blank by using following command :
git commit -a--allow-empty-message -m ""My gitHub Repository link:
